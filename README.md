# Thoughts App

This Android application is a simple yet powerful tool to keep track of your thoughts. Built using XML and Kotlin, it features a minimalist design with two fragments, a splash screen, and the ability to display new thoughts or retrieve previously saved ones from the internal storage.

## Features

- **Thought Display**: The app consists of two fragments - one for displaying new thoughts and another for retrieving saved thoughts from the internal storage.
- **Splash Screen**: Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a visually appealing splash screen.
- **Internal Storage**: Users can save their thoughts in a TXT file in the internal storage, which can be accessed and displayed within the app.
- **Frame Layout**: The main screen of the app includes a frame layout to seamlessly switch between different fragments and display saved text thoughts.
